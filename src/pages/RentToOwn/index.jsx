                            Are you shopping for a storage building with affordable payment options? If so, rent to own may be the perfect choice for you. At Leland’s, we offer a wide range of rent-to-own products, including storage sheds, finished sheds, storage barns, wood garages, and playhouses. You can rent from our range of products, and if you’re happy with your purchase, you simply make the agreed number of installment payments, and the building is yours!

                        Rent to own (RTO) is an affordable payment option with no credit check! All rent to own contracts are divided into monthly payments, which are figured into the price of the building. You only pay a deposit when applicable and the initial payment, then we deliver the building!

                        As with any contract where you pay for something over time, the total cost is higher than the cash price. The extra charges are not finance charges. Since this is a rental contract, rental fees are assessed. We do not charge penalties if you wish to pay off the contract early. In fact, we will give you a discount on the contract amount!

                        RTO is a rental program, not a loan, so NO credit is required. You are simply renting the rental property on a month-by-month basis. The RTO contract may be canceled at any time. Simply call and request that the rental property be picked up from your location.

                        There is no interest rate or finance charge. However, since this is a rental contract, rental fees are charged. The total contract amount may be figured by multiplying the monthly payment amount by the contract term.

                        The contract terms are easy to understand, and the cost of renting is low. There’s no interest rate or finance charge, but since this agreement does include rental fees, they will be applied as part of the monthly payment amount.

                        Early Pay Off (EPO) is offered as a promotion for customers who want to save money by paying off their contracts early. At any time during the contract, you may pay off the contract in full and receive this discount. EPO ranges from 40% to 60% of the remaining unused portion of the contract.

Under United States Bankruptcy Law § 365, should you file bankruptcy, you have the option at that time to assume or reject the contract. You should consult legal advice for complete information and provide a copy of your Rental Purchase Agreement.

If your payment is late, it may be subject to a late charge of up to $10.00. See your contract for details. Pay close attention to your due date and pay on time to avoid having your building picked up. If your account is past due, the rental company may pick up the building during normal daylight hours.

                        When you get a rent-to-own (we will refer to RTO from here on) building versus a financed one, the customer has no obligation to continue making the payments if he/she gets in a financial bind later on. So if you get an RTO building from Leland’s and 6 months later you realize you are over-leveraged, you can simply call in and have your building picked up, and your payments stop.

                        If you quit at any time, this does NOT hurt your credit (financing DOES NOT work this way). If you call in to cancel your rental and later you need another building, you can order another one, and for being upfront on your first one, you will not even hurt your credit/relationship with Leland’s.

                        Since this is a rental contract and not financing, paying money down and financing the rest is not possible. As a rental, the payments are figured on the full value of the building. Making a larger payment up front is the same as paying the rent in advance because we will apply it to future months’ rent.

                        Most certainly. Flexibility is one of the greatest features of the rent-to-own program.

The best part of all – it does not damage your credit!
