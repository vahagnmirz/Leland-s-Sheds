                        A quick elevator pitch would go something like this; “Leland’s stands apart from competition because we deliver with the service of “small” with the solid warranty of “large”. Leland’s is local.

                        Most other big name brands in the shed industry are out of state corporate companies who hire local contractors, who have no care for quality, no care for customer service, and who have no intention to be here for the long haul. In fact we see them from time to time, set up dealerships for a couple of months and suddenly they are gone. Leland’s has chosen rather to build it’s brand in a solid way, one town at a time.

                        In order to prepare for delivery, please have the desired location of your new Leland’s product clear of debris and obstructions of any kind. You may also want to mow the location to keep your unit from setting on tall grass. Since your new shed or outdoor living structure will be delivered fully assembled, clear access to the site is crucial for quick and simple delivery. This helps to ensure a pleasant delivery experience for you.
